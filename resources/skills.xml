<skill number="5">
<name>Linguistics</name>
<description>Speaking and understanding the tongues of monsters, spirits and other races is a much prized skill for a traveler in the Staglands, helping you win friends with unconventional and misunderstood parties, and deciphering runes and ancient tomes.

With Linguistics, you can unlock the powers of the Incantation Book, and use its runes to curse your enemies and control the elements.

Linguistics Skill Uses:

@

With an Incantation Book you can type chants that will be shouted at a nearby friend or foe, enchant certain items, and make changes to the environment. Incantations require a prefix and an action word, and if your curse is aimed at a mortal or item, the true name of your target. 

Amongst the better skilled apprentices of linguists, it is common to use Incantation Books to pickpocket neighbors with the simple curse "Vrosk Rife Gheorghe", the prefix "vrosk" aiming the spell at a mortal, the action word "rife" indicating an intention to pickpocket, and "Gheorge" being the poor soul about to be short a brooch. 

(Useable inventory item)

Condemn a single target's body to ruin by sending it plundering into a feverish wreck, weakening their ability to quickly act and even manage to hold their weapon. The longer the duration a sorcerer invokes this spell on a target, the more intense the affliction and chances the target will drop their held weapon.

<description>@Morphing School@
Polymorph your body into that of a mainland feline, the fox eared Shraazen. As a nimble cat, the sorcerer can be astonishingly evasive while in and out of combat, increasing dodge chance and movement speed. This spell is a favorite for scouts and spies looking for a quick getaway, entrance, or to toy with their opponents. Sorcerers are said to be able to even evade magical assaults with the more knowledge invested.

<name>Morph Into Wolf</name>
<description>@Morphing School@
Polymorph your body into a ferocious western-lands wolf, with blackish red fur and brutally sharp claws. Found commonly in the winter forests, the nocturnal beast is outfitted for hunting large prey that stray in its territory, and are rarely seen outside the thickest of forests. The magical conjuring of its skin and mind can be amplified with increased combat prowess and agility.

<skill number="74" spritename="Hallucinagon">
<name>Hallucinogen</name>
<description>@Herbology School@
Conjure an abomination inside a target's mind. While the abomination writhes and tears within their mind and memories, horrors lash out from the corners of their mind's eye, creating dreadful images of past mistakes, horrifically killed loved ones, and anguish beyond reason. The target flees in terror and rends at their body to try to remove the hallucinogenic corruption. The more concentrated the caster's spell, the more compelled to kill oneself while under the magical hallucinogen.

<description>@Flesh School@
Issuing a magical infestation to degrade the immunities of a target, a caster can cause an immense sickness. Through this sickness a usually simple ailment created within can cause immense pain and internal bleeding, while also lowering the target's strength through frequent throws of the body trying to remove said ailment. A potent casting can cause greater damage, and the longer the casting is in effect the weaker the target will become.

<name>Strangling Vines</name>
<description>@Herbology School@
Hatch a quick growing seedling that magically erupts and grows to massive sizes below the surface of your targeted ground. The seed has a parasitic mind of its own, and latches onto creatures above ground. It lashes out at targets with barbed branches, grinding at armor and flesh, and wrangles what limbs it can to slow targets down and ail their agility.Â Â The more potent the spell, the higher the chance the seedling can entangle those above it, though it could embrace both friend and foe.

<name>Ethereal Weapon</name>
<description>@Forging School@
After summoning the necessary magical energies to safely keep the blade intact, a sorcerer can emit a long ethereal blade to wield. While with the snap of his fingers the blade can appear, it will also be removed from Vol when the energy to contain it wanes. The more powerful the casting, the more potent and devastating the blade.

Illuminating a target with the moon's unyielding light, you can magically mirror their destruction by transmuting it into a healing beam that is reflected back at any companions. The more destruction your target does, the more healing is reflected back to your party. The more powerful the casting, the more augmented the reflection.

<description>@Morphing School@
Polymorph a target into a fiend, transmuting its physical appearance to those around it so much that they are compelled to squelch it from their sight. Even their allies can be frenzied with the need to kill them in their new skin. Upon death, the fiend absorbs the hatred around it and explodes onto its allies, wounding them both physically and emotionally. The more potent the illusion of the fiend by the caster, the more hatred it can absorb and in turn inflict back at allies.

Polymorph you and your companions into a gang of large winged bats, with unparalleled speed. Bats can traverse and scout faster than other winged creatures, and are the morphing spell of choice for both engaging and disengaging battles. Their height and small size can also allow entrance into difficult to reach places for regular mortals.

@Herbology School@
There are many poisons that can decay even the most hardy of adventurer's organs within seconds. Even more dangerous are what those who dwell in the Spirit Realm are armed with, an ethereal corrosive that tortures the bodies of mortals. Sorcerers have devised a healing beam by summoning fairies from the air, transmuting them into a fine crystal, and concentrating a beam of it into a target. The more potent and trained the spell, the faster the caster can summon these fairies for transmuting. The beam, upon contact with the target, can instantly heal them of any poisons or ethereal damage.

Open a portal at your feet that links to one where you cast to on the ground. Enemies that near your portal will slide in and reappear on your cast point, taking some damage along the way. Once you create your portal, it will stay without you needing to continually fuel it with arcane power.

(IntMod = Intelligence # > 10) 	
	
Cast on ground

*If already cast, a sorcerer cannot stack another Planar Jump, but can re-cast it in a new location and reset the time it exists in a new location.
	
Cast speed: 5 sec.
